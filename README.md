This is a Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to mimic the core features of Spotify's user interface, providing a visually appealing and responsive design. It demonstrates the following:

*	Interactive UI: A clean, intuitive, and user-friendly layout resembling Spotify.
*	Dynamic Content: Use of JavaScript to enable interactive functionalities like song playback, playlist navigation, and more.
*	Responsive Design: Fully responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices of different screen sizes.

This project is a great learning exercise to deepen my understanding of front-end web development, focusing on combining modern CSS techniques and JavaScript interactivity.
